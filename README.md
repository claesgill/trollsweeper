# Trollsweeper

This is a replica of the original Minesweeper puzzle game, but instead of mines it is trollfaces.

The code is somewhat generic. You can play around with the variables in the ```SetupCanvas()```-function:

* `cols` is the number of columns
* `rows` is the number of rows
* `cellSize` is the size of one cell
* `numTrollCells` is the number of trolls hiding

If you do not want to test the code there is a live version on my [webpage](http://www.claesgill.com/trollsweeper).

**TODO: Make the user deside the number of cells and trolls.**
